# CurioNoah
CurioNoah is a set of applications that arouse curiosity and help you explore through intellectual pursuits.

***Cloning and building the environment from scratch is too much work, so it will be improved.***


## Why am I working on this project?

It is solely to improve my overall development capabilities.
This includes everything from bit infrastructures teritory such as Docker, DB, backend, and frontend development.
In addition, this is an ambitious project that aims to reach out to QA and performance tuning. (Yeah, I get it. I'm not a genius, so these things will be very challenging.)
